# Bob's Platformer

This repository contains Bob's Platformer, a 2D platformer game inspired by classics like Super Mario Bros.  This project was developed during one of my summer breaks as a learning exercise to explore game engines and game development.

## About the Project

Bob's Platformer was created to learn the Godot game engine and its scripting language, GDScript.  It represents my first foray into game development using a dedicated engine and demonstrates my ability to quickly pick up new technologies and apply them to create a functional game.

## Key Features

*   **Classic Platformer Gameplay:**  Jump, run, and navigate through the map, collecting coins and avoiding enemies.
*   **Godot Engine:**  Built using the Godot Engine, leveraging its built-in tools and features for game development.
*   **GDScript:**  Scripted using GDScript, Godot's custom scripting language.

## How to Run the Game

1.  **Download Godot:** Download and install the Godot Engine from the official [Godot website](https://godotengine.org/).
2.  **Clone or Download the Project:** Clone this repository or download the project files as a ZIP archive.
3.  **Open in Godot:** Open the Godot Engine. Use the "Import" or "Open" project functionality within Godot to load the project from the directory where you cloned or extracted it.
4.  **Run the Game:** Press the "Play" button within the Godot editor to run the game.

## Technical Details

*   **Game Engine:** Godot Engine
*   **Scripting Language:** GDScript
